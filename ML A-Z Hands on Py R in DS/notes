Most (linear,multi,poly)regressors do Feature Scaling inherently (not SVR)
Dummy variable trap is because together they have fake influence on prediction
Lesser P value means more significant. Usual threshold is 5%
R-Squared is biased (more variables increase R-Squared), so use Adjusted R-Squared which has counter-measure for number of new variables
