[Nearest Neighbour]
1-NN, K-NN
Value for doc
    Bag of words (words-frequencies)
    TF-IDF
        emphasize freq in local(Term Freq), rare in global(Inverse Doc Freq)
        IDF = log(#docs / 1 + #docs with word)
        TF*IDF
    Euclidean, cosine(for sparse) similarity
    Normalize to not encourage frequency based on length of doc
Distance calc
    Brute force
    KD-Tree
        Build tree by splitting data into BST
        Split on widest or alternate dimension
        Split at median, center,...
        Stop for threshold or width
        K-NN => maintain kth distanced node
