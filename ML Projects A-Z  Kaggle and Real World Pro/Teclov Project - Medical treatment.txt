View data and figure out what kind of problem it is
Pre-Process
Missing data (Impute, ...)
Test Train Split
Check that the split is good (impartial)
    Log Loss (takes probability into account, not only the final class)
    As log loss can go to infinity, use a random(worst case model) and compare with it
Response encoding ???
    Replace categorical with something possible based on converting target class into something
    algo?
        add <number of classes> cols
        for each row
            for each col add the val P(y=<col>|row[x])
Laplace smoothing   (to deal with unknown data on test set)
    apply [ (val + alpha) 
                /
            (N + (alpha * #classes)) ]
Callibrated classifier

# Logistic Regression works even for one hot encoding
# Naive bayes, Random Forest, KNN need Response encoding (dimensionality)

Balance impartial data fo logistic regression
